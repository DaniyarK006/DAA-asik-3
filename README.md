# MST Algorithms – Assignment 3  | Daniyar Kairatov
Implementation of Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms in Java

This project implements two classical algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):  
- Prim’s Algorithm (priority queue–based)  
- Kruskal’s Algorithm (union–find–based)

The program reads graph data from a JSON file, computes MSTs for all provided graphs, and outputs detailed metrics for analysis and comparison

##  What It Does
1. Reads `ass_3_input.json`
2. Computes MSTs for each graph using both algorithms  
3. Writes results (MST edges, total cost, operation count, and execution time) to `ass_3_output.json`

##  How to Compile and Run

### Linux/macOS/WSL
```bash
# Compile all source files
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")

# Run the main program
java -cp out utils.Main
````

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
javac -d out (Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.java | ForEach-Object { $_.FullName })
java -cp out utils.Main
```

  Summary of Results

| Graph ID | Algorithm | MST Cost | Execution Time (ms) | Operation Count |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 1        | Prim’s    | 17       | 1.24                | 156             |

> Note: Results are based on local runs in IntelliJ IDEA
> Operation counts represent total key operations (comparisons, union/finds, edge selections)

Algorithm Comparison

Prim’s Algorithm

* Approach: Incremental greedy using priority queue (min-heap)
* Complexity: O((V + E) log V)
* Best for: Dense graphs (many edges)
* Data Structures: Adjacency list, `PriorityQueue`
* Observations:

  * Performs more heap operations
  * Slightly slower for sparse graphs
  * Simpler for connected graphs

### Kruskal’s Algorithm

* Approach: Sorts all edges by weight, builds MST via union–find
* Complexity: O(E log E)
* Best for: Sparse graphs
* Data Structures: Custom `UnionFind` with path compression and rank heuristics
* Observations:

  * Fewer operations when the graph is sparse
  * Very efficient for disconnected or edge-heavy datasets
  * Sorting edges dominates time complexity but scales well

---

##  Conclusions

Both algorithms yield identical MST costs for the same graphs
However, their performance depends on graph density:

* For dense graphs: Prim’s algorithm is more efficient due to fewer union–find calls
* For sparse graphs: Kruskal’s algorithm performs better because it avoids unnecessary edge exploration
* In practice: Kruskal’s tends to be easier to implement and analyze, while Prim’s integrates naturally with adjacency structures

| Condition                  | Recommended Algorithm | Reason                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Sparse Graph (few edges)   | Kruskal’s             | Faster edge sorting and simple unions |
| Dense Graph (many edges)   | Prim’s                | Efficient edge selection via heap     |
| Memory-limited Environment | Kruskal’s             | Fewer auxiliary structures            |
| Real-time / Dynamic Graph  | Prim’s                | Incremental updates possible          |
